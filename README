Add the following line in your ~/.bashrc file to adjust your 
path for Jaegerlab settings:
---
. ~jaegerlab/brute_scripts/rc.sh
---

To learn about the Sun Grid Engine (SGE) on how to submit 
and monitor jobs, start from the "man sge_intro" manual page. 

Use the "qsub" command to submit jobs to the SGE.

Example:

$ qsub -t 1:100 ~jaegerlab/brute_scripts/sge_perllock.sh my_gen_script.g my_conductances.par

will launch 100 jobs processing the given parameter file.

Files in this directory:
------------------------------
checkMissing.pl		- Cross-checks files and parameter lines to see 
			if any simulations have been missed.
checksims		- Deprecated: counts data files on each node of a cluster.
dist_params		- Deprecated: Distributes separate parameter 
			files to each node.
dosim			- Mark the first available line in a parameter 
			file and return it.
forall			- Deprecated, use dsh: run command on all nodes.
forallrsh		- Deprecated, use dsh: run command on all nodes using rsh.
lockLinuxFile		- Request mutual exclusive lock on a file and run a command.
paramRanges.txt		- Example parameter definition file for brute force search.
paramScan.pl		- Parameter file generator for brute force search. 
			Reads the parameter definition file.
qcountcpus		- Asks SGE how many CPUs are running.
rc.sh			- Jaeger Lab startup script to set up paths, etc.
runbatch		- Deprecated: Runs genesis repeatedly until all 
			parameter rows are processed. Use qsub as shown 
			above with one of the sge_* scripts.
runbatchenv		- Deprecated: Same as runbatch, but passes parameters
			to Genesis through an environment variable.
runbatchremain		- Deprecated: Same as runbatch, but runs as many processes
			as to finish the remaining rows in a parameter file.
run_genesis.sh		- Simple SGE submission script that runs a Genesis script 
			without refering to a parameter file.
sge_perllock_local.sh	- Deprecated: SGE submission script that uses network
			file locking to access rows of a central parameter file.
sge_perllock.sh		- SGE submission script, same as *_local.sh above, but
			uses ssh to connect to master node and request file locking.
sge_perllock_test.sh	- Empty SGE submission script for testing purposes. Waits 
			for a few seconds instead of running Genesis.
splitparfile		- Split a parameter file into two parts.
takebacksim		- Unmarks the last executed parameter row.
